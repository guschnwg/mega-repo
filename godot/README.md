# Godot for my PSVita

`make full-vita` builds the image and compiles for the vita
`make vita` if you already built

`make clean-cache-dir-macos` cleans the Cache folder, this solves some issues with exporting.
For some reason I was getting some cache for images after building them for the first time with incorrect ones.
Also with some wrong vita_release.zip file.
